Key Points:
Fire needs three things to exist: heat, fuel, and oxygen. This is called the fire triangle. Fire helps us cook and stay warm, but can be dangerous.

‚úÖ Heat comes from matches or sparks
‚úÖ Fuel is things that burn like wood and paper
‚úÖ Oxygen is the air we breathe

Do's and Don'ts:
Do: Learn about fire safety from adults
Don't: Play with matches or lighters`

‚úÖ Test smoke detectors monthly
‚úÖ Keep matches away from children
‚úÖ Don't put too many plugs in one outlet
‚úÖ Clean up spills quickly

Key Points:
If there's a fire, get out fast and call for help. Remember: things can be replaced, but you cannot!

Step 1: GET OUT FAST - Don't try to fight the fire
Step 2: CALL FOR HELP - Call 101 in India or 911 in USA
Step 3: STAY OUT - Wait for firefighters

If your clothes catch fire:
STOP - Don't run
DROP - Drop to the ground
ROLL - Roll back and forth

Do's and Don'ts:
Do: Meet your family at a planned safe spot outside
Don't: Go back inside for anything`

‚úÖ You might hear a rumble or feel dizzy
‚úÖ Earth's plates slip and cause shakes
