# Flood Safety Quiz Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. InteractiveQuiz Sidebar import error - now uses ResponsiveLayout
2. QuizOverview missing key props warning - fixed
3. Backend API connection verified - running on http://localhost:5001
4. API URLs updated to use Vite proxy (/api instead of http://localhost:5001/api)

## Quiz URL Issue
The URL `http://localhost:8080/quiz/68c155f2b7054861b5af1202/overview` refers to a quiz ID that doesn't exist in your backend database.

## Available Modules
Your backend has the following modules:
- **68c0873663edbe8c292578b0** - Flood Safety ⭐ (Perfect for our quiz!)
- 68c04c0b41825d403c5d7dbe - Fire Safety  
- 68c0873663edbe8c292578a2 - Earthquake Safety
- 68c0873663edbe8c292578b9 - Fire Safety
- 68c0873663edbe8c292578c2 - Cyclone Safety
- 68c0873663edbe8c292578ca - Pandemic Safety

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Database Import (Recommended)
1. Access your MongoDB database
2. Insert the quiz data from `flood-quiz-data.json` into the `quizzes` collection
3. Make sure to set the `moduleId` to `68c0873663edbe8c292578b0` (Flood Safety module)
4. The system will generate a new quiz ID automatically

### Option 2: Backend Admin Panel
If your backend has an admin panel or quiz creation interface:
1. Log in as an administrator
2. Create a new quiz with the data from `flood-quiz-data.json`
3. Assign it to the "Flood Safety" module

### Option 3: API Development
The `/api/quizzes` POST endpoint returned a 404, which means:
- The endpoint doesn't exist, or
- Authentication is required, or
- The route is different

You may need to check your backend code to find the correct endpoint for quiz creation.
